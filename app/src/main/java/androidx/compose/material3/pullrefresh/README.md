## About this package

This app uses the Compose Material 3 library.
Unfortunately, the PullRefresh-functionality was not yet implemented into Material 3.
Therefore, the code for the PullRefresh-functionality was manually added to this app from the
Material 2 library.

Additionally, as the design of the RefreshIndicator uses the Material 2 color scheme, the
indicator's background color was manually changed to use the Material 3 tertiary color
